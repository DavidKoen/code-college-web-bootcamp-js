//     make fields private as much as possible and provide access to them using getters and
//     setters. This way, the properties cannot be set from outside without the object itself
//     being in control. This principle is called encapsulation. The class encapsulates the

//         Please note that we do not access firstname as if it was a function. If you put two

// INHERITANCE 

/* Inheritance is one of the key concepts of OOP. It is the concept that classes can have
child classes that inherit the properties and methods from the parent class. For
example, if you needed all sorts of vehicle objects in your application, you could
specify a class named Vehicle in which you specify some shared properties and
methods of vehicles. You would then go ahead and create the specific child classes
based on this Vehicle class, for example, boat, car, bicycle, and motorcycle. */
