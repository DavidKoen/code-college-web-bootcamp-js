/* The Document Object Model (DOM) is a lot more exciting than it may sound
at first. In this chapter, we will introduce you to the DOM. This is a fundamental
concept you will need to understand before working with JavaScript on web pages. It
grabs an HTML page and turns it into a logical tree. 

Browser Object Model (BOM). The BOM holds all the methods
and properties for JavaScript to interact with the browser. This is information related
to previous pages visited, the size of the window of the browser, and also the DOM. */
